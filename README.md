# 🏠 House Price Predictor

A machine learning-based web app that predicts **house prices** from user-provided features using a trained **regression model**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Predicts house prices based on various input parameters like:
  - Number of bedrooms, living area, etc.
* Uses a **pre-trained ML regression model** (e.g., Random Forest, or Linear Regression).
* User-friendly **Streamlit UI** for form-based input.
